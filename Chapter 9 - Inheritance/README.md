# Chapter 9 Independent Exercise - Cake! Cake! Cake!

- Create a superclass called Cake that has two fields: flavor and price, and a
constructor that accepts the flavor. Getter and setter methods should be created
for the fields.
- Create a BirthdayCake class which inherits from Cake and has a field called candles.
Its constructor should set the flavor. Include getter and setter method.
- Create a WeddingCake class which inherits from Cake and has a field called tiers. Its
constructor should set the flavor. Include getter and setter method.
- Create a TasteTester class to test out your inheritance by printing the flavor and
price of each of these types of cakes.


The first one is going to be a superclass called `Cake` and it will have two fields, `flavor` and `price`. Go ahead and make getter and setter methods for both of these fields.

Next create a `BirthdayCake` class which will inherit from the `Cake` class and it has a field of its own called `candles`. Go ahead and include the getter and setter method for `candles`.

And then create a third class called `WeddingCake` which also inherits from `Cake` and has a field called `tiers` and you'll include a getter and setter method for this.

And then finally, a class called `TasteTester` which will test out your inheritance.
