1. Given that Car inherits from Vehicle, and no constructors have been explicitly defined in either class, which of these will be called first upon the instantiation of Car?
[ ] a- Car()
[x] b- Vehicle()
[ ] c- Neither because no constructors were defined

2. A subclass's default constructor can only access the default constructor of its superclass.
[ ] a- True
[x] b- False

3. Given that Vegetable inherits from Food, and `super("Broccoli")` is called from one of Vegetable's constructors, which of the following will be executed upon this call?
[ ] a- Vegetable()
[ ] b- Vegetable(String name)
[ ] c- Food()
[x] d- Food(String name)

4. An explicit call to a superclass's constructor must be the very first line of the calling constructor.
[x] a- True
[ ] b- False

5. If a superclass has constructors but none of them are a default constructor, which of the following is true?
[ ] a- The subclass's default constructor will automatically call the superclass's implicit default constructor.
[ ] b- The subclass has to define constructors that match the signatures of those which are in its superclass.
[x] c- The subclass has to explicitly call one of the existing non-default constructors of its superclass from one of its constructors.
[ ] d- The first constructor defined in the superclass will automatically be called from the subclass's default constructor.
