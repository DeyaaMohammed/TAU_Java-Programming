# Chapter 13 Independent Exercise - Dividing By Zero

Write the following statement and execute:
```java
int c = 30/0;
```
Update program to handle exception.

Print a statement after division to say "Division is fun". This statement should be outputted no matter what.

When you execute this, you'll see an exception, so I want you to update that program to handle the exception.

Then print a statement after the division to say, "Division is fun." This statement should be outputted no matter what happens in your program.
