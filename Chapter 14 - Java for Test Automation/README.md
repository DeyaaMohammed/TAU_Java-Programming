# Chapter 14 Independent Exercise - Coin Toss Game

I have one final exercise for you. Consider it as a final project. It's exercising a lot of the things that we've learned throughout this course. Of course, it's optional, but I strongly encourage you to do it.

You're going to create an object-oriented coin toss game — this project will consist of three classes.

<br>The first class is `Coin`.

Create a Coin class which has the following:
- a field called side
- encapsulation
- constant variables for heads and tails
- a method called flip which randomly chooses heads or tails and assigns the value to side

It should contain a field called `side`, encapsulation, constant variables for heads and tails, a method called `flip()`, which randomly chooses heads or tails and assigns that value to side.

<br>Your second class will be one called `Player`.

Create a Player class which has the following:
- fields called name and guess
- encapsulation
- a constructor which accepts name

This one will have fields called `name` and `guess`.

You'll also have encapsulation in `Player`, and then add a constructor which accepts a player's name.

<br>Finally, the third class will be one called `CoinTossGame` — which creates two players.

Create a CoinTossGame class which:
- creates two Players
- asks Player 1 to choose Heads or Tails
- ensures that Player 1 's guess is valid
- automatically assigns Player 2's guess to the opposite of what Player 1 chose
- flips the coin
- determines winner based on what coin landed on
- uses methods appropriately

It asks player 1 to choose heads or tails, and ensures that player 1’s guess is valid.

Don't move on until player 1 actually has a valid guess.

Then, automatically assign player 2’s guess to the opposite of what player 1 chose.

You're going to flip the coin in this class to determine which side it landed on. Then you're going to determine a winner based on what the coin landed on.

Also, be sure to use methods appropriately in this class.
