# Chapter 5 Independent Exercise - Phone Bill Calculator

Calculate the final total of someone's cell phone bill.
Allow the operator to input the plan fee and the number of overage minutes.\
Charge the user 0.25 for every minute they were over their plan, and 15% tax on
the subtotal.\
Create separate methods to calculate the tax, overage fees, and final total.
Print the itemized bill.

So, what you're going to do is allow the user to input the plan fee and the number of overage minutes. And then you're going to charge 25 cents for every minute that they've gone over, and then a 15% tax on the subtotal.

I want you to create separate methods to calculate the tax, to calculate the overage fees, and to calculate and print the final total.

Please print this as an itemized bill. I have an example of the output expected down below.

#### Example Output:

    Enter base cost of the plan:
    82.45
    Enter overage minutes:
    9
    Phone Bill Statement
    Plan: $82.45
    Overage: $2.25
    Tax: $12.71
    Total: $97.41
