## Introduction

The "[Java Programming](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/java-programming-course/)" Course on Test Automation University is an invaluable resource for learning Java programming from scratch. This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments and quizzes presented throughout the course. It aims to provide a consolidated view of my understanding and progress.


## Directory Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Chapter X/`: Each chapter from the course has its own directory.
  - `README.md`: This file contains the exercise problem statement to solve for the chapter.
  - `src/`: This directory, located within the chapter directory, contains Java source code files. These files represent my own implementations to solve the exercises presented in the chapter.
  - `Chapter Xy Quiz.txt`: A text file that contains my answers to the quizzes associated with this chapter.


## Usage

You can explore my solutions by navigating to the specific programming assignment directories and quiz text files. Each assignment's README file provides the exercise problem statement to solve for the chapter.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference, study material, or review material to enhance your Java programming skills.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have alternative solutions, suggestions for improvements, or corrections to my answers, please consider submitting a pull request. If you encounter any issues with my solutions or have additional insights to share, please open an issue.

Please ensure that any contributions align with the course content and are respectful of the course's academic integrity policies.
