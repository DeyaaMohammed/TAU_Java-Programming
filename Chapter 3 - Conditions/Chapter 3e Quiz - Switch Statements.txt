1. When is it ideal to use a switch statement?
[ ] a- When there is one possible path
[ ] b- When there are two possible paths
[x] c- When there are more than two possible paths

2. Which decision structure is interchangeable with the switch statement?
[ ] a- if
[ ] b- if-else
[x] c- if-else-if
[ ] d- nested ifs

3. Which type of expression does the condition of a switch statement evaluate?
[ ] a- Any

[x] c- Equality
[ ] d- Greater or less than

4. Each path of a switch statement is denoted by the word _____

[ ] b- switch
[ ] c- if
[ ] d- break

5. Which cases of a switch statement are executed?
[ ] a- All that are true
[x] b- The first one that is true
[ ] c- All that are false
[ ] d- The last one that is false

6. The purpose of the reserved word, break, is to ______
[ ] a- Exit an if block and enter an else block
[x] b- End a case block within a switch statement
[ ] c- Denote the end of the nested if statements
[ ] d- Close the input stream

7. When is the default case within a switch statement executed?
[ ] a- Before all other cases are executed
[ ] b- When there are no case statements present
[x] c- When the value being evaluated does not equal any of the case statements
[ ] d- After a case is executed

8. What will happen in a case where the break statement is omitted?
[x] a- The next case will also be executed
[ ] b- The program will crash
[ ] c- There will be a compilation error
[ ] d- The program will add it by default

9. Which decision structure is best for a case where there’s only one conditional path needed?
[x] a- if
[ ] b- if-else
[ ] c- if-else-if
[ ] d- nested ifs
[ ] e- switch

10. Which decision structure is best when there’s two conditional paths, where one should be executed if the condition is true and the other if the condition is false?
 [ ] a- if
 [x] b- if-else
 [ ] c- if-else-if
 [ ] d- nested ifs
 [ ] e- switch

11. Which decision structure is used when there are more than two conditional paths and its condition only checks for equality?
 [ ] a- if
 [ ] b- if-else
 [ ] c- if-else-if
 [ ] d- nested ifs
 [x] e- switch

12. Which decision structure can be used when you need to immediately check another condition if the first condition was met?
 [ ] a- if
 [ ] b- if-else
 [ ] c- if-else-if
 [x] d- nested ifs
 [ ] e- switch
