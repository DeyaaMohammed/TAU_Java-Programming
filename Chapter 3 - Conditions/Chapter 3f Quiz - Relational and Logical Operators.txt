[ ] a- if(a = 5) 
[x] b- if(a == 5) 
[ ] c- if(a.equals(5)) 
[ ] d- if(5 = a) 

3. Which is true of logical operators?
[ ] a- They are interchangeable with relational operators
[x] b- They are used to combine two conditions to result in a single boolean value
[ ] c- They are data types
[ ] d- There are an infinite number of them to choose from

[ ] d- && 

7. What’s the value of (2>3 && 4<=4)?
[ ] a- True
[x] b- False

8. What’s the value of (9 != 0 || 5>5)?
